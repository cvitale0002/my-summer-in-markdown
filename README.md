## Introduction 
My name is Chloe, and I am a junior at Chatsworth High School. I play volleyball for Chatsworth and also on a club team called Socal Legends. 

## My Summer 
Over the summer I traveled to **Phoenix, Arizona** to play in a tournament. Luckily, I got to play with all my friends and we ended up placing way higher than expected. Another fun thing I did in the summer was seeing one of my bestfriends from Indiana. She came in June, and I saw her multiple times.

## Goals for the School Year
My goal for the 2024-2025 school year is to pass all my classes with a **B** or higher. My goal for this class is to **PASS** the AP test in May. 

## Favorite Summer Memory with Friends
My favorite summer memory with my friends was driving around and trying new food places. After the new food places we ended up coming back to my house to swim and fortunately they ended up sleeping over!!

## Memorable Moment
My all time favorite memory this summer was getting my car. It is a 2024 Volkswagen Tiguan. The car is all white with black interior.
